# Microprocessor-Systems-Project
Using Keil to program a microcontroller in C with ARM Cortex-M4F microprocessor to collect spatial measurement data with a time-of-flight sensor that transmits data with I2C communication from sensor to microcontroller. Microcontroller transmitted measurement data to a PC using serial communication where the data was then conditioned and visualized as a 3D image with a program written in MATLAB.
