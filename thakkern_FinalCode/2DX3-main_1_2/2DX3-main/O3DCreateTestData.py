## Title O3D Create Test Data
#
#   Purpose: This example Python program simulates data received from a
#   sensor by writing the expected format of example data to a file. The
#   visualization will be demonstrated using a Python module called Open3D.
#
#   Special notes:
#       1. Open3D only works with Pythons 3.6-3.9.  It does not work with 3.10
#       2. For this eample you should run it in IDLE.  Anaconda/Conda/Jupyter
#       require different Open3D graphing methods (these methods are poorly documented)
#       3. Under Windows 10 you may need to install the MS Visual C++ Redistributable bundle
#           https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170
#       4. VirtualBox does not support OpenGL. If you're running Windows under Virtualbox or
#       your system doesn't support OpenGL (very rare), then you can install an OpenGL emulator dll
#           https://fdossena.com/?p=mesa/index.frag (unzip and copy opengl32.dll into Python dir)
